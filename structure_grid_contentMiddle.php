This is my simple retro PHP website made with CSS GRID and FLEXBOX.
</br>
    CSS GRID was used specially for the main layout of the entire page.
    With <code>grid-template-rows: 5%  5% 35% 25% 25% 5%;</code> I create 5 rows and with 
    <code>grid-template-areas:</code> I created 3 columns. 
    Besides I used a simple keyframe <code> @media only screen and (max-width: 600px)</code> to make the website responsive.
</br>
</br>
    Inside the top navigation bars I applied <code>display: flex;</code> to layout horizontally the 
    links and <code>justify-content: flex-end;</code> to position the elements to the left side of the screen.
</br>You may notice that I like scroll bars and I am not really fan of too much blank space.

<h1>Phonetics</h1>
<p>
The videos in the Pronunciation Tips section of this site are presented by Alex Bellem.
<br>
Alex has an undergraduate degree in Arabic and Turkish. She followed this with an MA in (Theoretical) Linguistics at University College London (UCL) and a PhD in Linguistics at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) where she focused on Arabic phonology and phonetics.
<br>
She's also a CELTA-qualified English language teacher and spent a few years teaching English as a Foreign Language. At the time these videos were made in early 2008 Alex was lecturing part-time in the Linguistics Department at SOAS and was working as a Pronunciation Linguist in the BBC's Pronunciation Unit.
<br>
The videos were shot by J-P Newman and many thanks to Matt Cleghorn for his enormous contribution to their editing.
<br>
Thanks also to Professor J C Wells for his insights.

<h1>Sounds and Spelling</h1>
<p>
It's important to note that the spelling of a word is not always an accurate guide to how it is pronounced. Similarly the pronunciation of a word is not always helpful when working out how that word should be spelt.
<br>
There are 26 letters in the English alphabet but there are many more sounds in the English language. This means that the number of sounds in a word is not always the same as the number of letters.
<br>
For example, the word 'CAT' has three letters and three sounds but the word 'CATCH' has five letters but still only three sounds.
<br>
If we write these words using sound symbols, we can see exactly how many sounds they have.

<br>
<br>
<br>
CAT is written - cat /kæt/
<br>
CATCH is written - catch /kæʧ/ 
<br>
<br>
<br>
In 'CATCH' the three letters TCH are one sound represented by one symbol /ʧ/
</p>


<hr>
<h1>Schwa</h1>
<p>
Schwa is the name for the most common sound in English. It is a weak, unstressed sound and it occurs in many words. It is often the sound in grammar words such as articles and prepositions.
<br>
Getting the schwa sound correct is a good way of making your pronunciation more accurate and natural.
<br>
The phonemic symbol for this sound is /ə/ . 
</p>

<h2>Not just a letter</h2>
<p>
The sound schwa does not only represent a single letter. In some words it is the sound of several letters or even a whole syllable.
<br>
This is often, but not only, seen in words which have a syllable made up of a vowel letter followed by the letter 'r'. Remember the schwa sound is only used if the syllable which it is in is not stressed.
<br>
Listen to these examples, the schwa sounds are marked in red:

</p>

<h1>Connected Speech</h1>
<p>
When we speak naturally we do not pronounce a word, stop, then say the next word in the sentence. Fluent speech flows with a rhythm and the words bump into each other. To make speech flow smoothly the way we pronounce the end and beginning of some words can change depending on the sounds at the beginning and end of those words.
<br>
These changes are described as features of connected speech. 
</p>

<h2>Sounds link</h2>
<p>Linking is a way of joining the pronunciation of two words so that they are easy to say and flow together smoothly. In English there are different ways that this happens.
<br>
Consonant to vowel linking - when the first word ends with a consonant sound and the second word begins with a vowel sound. 
<br>
Vowel to vowel linking - when certain vowels come next to each other an extra sound is added to make the link smooth. 
</p>

<h2>Linking 'r'</h2>
<p>
In standard British English (RP) the letter 'r' after a vowel sound at the end of word is often not pronounced. However, when the following word begins with a vowel the /r/ sound is pronounced to make a smooth link
</p>

<h2>Sounds disappear</h2>
<p>
When the sounds /t/ or /d/ occur between two consonant sounds, they will often disappear completely from the pronunciation. 
</p>

<h2>Sounds join together</h2>
<p>
When a word ends in a consonant sound and the following word begins with the same consonant sound, we don't pronounce two sounds - both sounds are pronounced together as one. 
</p>


<h2>Sounds change</h2>
<p>
When a word ends in a consonant sound and the following word begins with a consonant sound, depending on the particular sounds, the last sound of the first word or both the last sound and the first sound of the next word can change. 
</p>

<hr>
<h1>Voicing</h1>
<p>
Some consonant sounds are voiced and some are voiceless. A voiceless sound is one that just uses air to make the sound and not the voice.
<br>
You can tell if a sound is voiced or not by putting your hand gently on your throat. When you say a sound, if you can feel a vibration it is a voiced sound.
<br>
Voicing is important because sometimes it's the only difference in the pronunciation of two very different words, such as 'bet' and 'pet'.
<br>
<br>
Bet /bet/ - the /b/ sound is voiced.
<br>
Pet /pet/ - the /p/ sound is voiceless.
</p>
